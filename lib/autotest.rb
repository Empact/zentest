# Autotest continuously runs your tests as you work on your project.
#
# Autotest periodically scans the files in your project for updates then
# figures out the appropriate tests to run and runs them.  If a test fails
# Autotest will run just that test until you get it to pass.
#
# If you want Autotest to start over from the top, hit ^C.  If you want
# Autotest to quit, hit ^C twice.
#
# Autotest uses a simple naming scheme to figure out how to map implementation
# files to test files following the Test::Unit naming scheme.
#
# * Test files must be stored in test/
# * Test files names must start with test_
# * Test classes must start with Test
# * Implementation files must be stored in lib/
# * Implementation files must match up with a test file named
#   test_.*implementation.rb
