** DESCRIPTION:
  
ZenTest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker
pace. ZenTest only works with Ruby and Test::Unit.

** FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
+ Scans your ruby code and tests and generates missing methods for you.
+ Includes a very helpful filter for Test::Unit output called unit_diff.rb
+ Includes a LinuxJournal article on testing with ZenTest written by Pat Eyler.

** SYNOPSYS:

  ZenTest.rb MyProject.rb TestMyProject.rb > missing.rb
  # edit missing.rb and merge appropriate parts into the above files.
  ./TestMyProject.rb | unit_diff.rb
  # Use unit_diff.rb to show you the actual differences in your failures.

** RULES:

ZenTest uses the following rules to figure out what code should be
generated:

+ Definition:
	+ CUT = Class Under Test
	+ TC = Test Class (for CUT)
+ TC's name is the same as CUT w/ "Test" prepended at every scope level.
	+ Example: TestA::TestB vs A::B.
+ CUT method names are used in CT, with "test_" prependend and optional "_ext" extensions for differentiating test case edge boundaries.
	+ Example:
		+ A::B#blah
		+ TestA::TestB#test_blah_normal
		+ TestA::TestB#test_blah_missing_file
+ All naming conventions are bidirectional with the exception of test extensions.

** REQUIREMENTS:

+ Ruby 1.6+
+ Test::Unit

** INSTALL:

+ No install instructions yet. TODO
