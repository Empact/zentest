** DESCRIPTION:
  
ZenTest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker
pace. ZenTest only works with Ruby and Test::Unit.

** FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
+ Scans your ruby code and tests and generates missing methods for you.

** SYNOPSYS:

  ZenTest.rb MyProject.rb TestMyProject.rb > missing.rb
  # edit missing.rb and merge appropriate parts into the above files.

** RULES:

ZenTest uses the following rules to figure out what code should be
generated:

+ Definition: CUT = class under test, TC = Test Class (for CUT)
+ TC's name is the same as CUT w/ "Test" prepended at every scope level.
	+ Example: TestA::TestB vs A::B.
+ CUT method names are used in CT, with "test_" prependend and optional "_ext" extensions for differentiating test case edge boundaries.
	+ Example: A::B#blah vs TestA::TestB#test_blah_missing_file
+ All naming conventions are bidirectional with the exception of test extensions.

** REQUIREMENTS:

+ Ruby 1.6+
+ Test::Unit

** INSTALL:

+ No install instructions yet. TODO
