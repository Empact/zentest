== DESCRIPTION

ZenTest provides 4 different tools: zentest, unit_diff, autotest, and
multiruby.

ZenTest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing
code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker
pace. ZenTest only works with Ruby and Test::Unit.

unit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from
actual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.

autotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during
development. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the
corresponding dependent tests.

multiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great
for compatibility checking!

There are two strategies intended for ZenTest: test conformance
auditing and rapid XP.

For auditing, ZenTest provides an excellent means of finding methods
that have slipped through the testing process. I've run it against my
own software and found I missed a lot in a well tested
package. Writing those tests found 4 bugs I had no idea existed.

ZenTest can also be used to evaluate generated code and execute your
tests, allowing for very rapid development of both tests and
implementation.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS

* Scans your ruby code and tests and generates missing methods for you.
* Includes a very helpful filter for Test::Unit output called unit_diff.
* Continually and intelligently test only those files you change with autotest.
* Test against multiple versions with multiruby.
- Not the best doco in the world (my fault)
* Includes a LinuxJournal article on testing with ZenTest written by Pat Eyler.

== SYNOPSYS

  ZenTest MyProject.rb TestMyProject.rb > missing.rb

  ./TestMyProject.rb | unit_diff

  autotest

  multiruby ./TestMyProject.rb

== RULES

ZenTest uses the following rules to figure out what code should be
generated:

* Definition:
  * CUT = Class Under Test
  * TC = Test Class (for CUT)
* TC's name is the same as CUT w/ "Test" prepended at every scope level.
  * Example: TestA::TestB vs A::B.
* CUT method names are used in CT, with "test_" prependend and optional "_ext" extensions for differentiating test case edge boundaries.
  * Example:
    * A::B#blah
    * TestA::TestB#test_blah_normal
    * TestA::TestB#test_blah_missing_file
* All naming conventions are bidirectional with the exception of test extensions.

== METHOD MAPPING

Method names are mapped bidirectionally in the following way:

  method	test_method
  method?	test_method_eh		(too much exposure to Canadians :)
  method!	test_method_bang
  method=	test_method_equals
  []		test_index
  *		test_times
  ==		test_equals2
  ===		test_equals3

Further, any of the test methods should be able to have arbitrary
extensions put on the name to distinguish edge cases:

  method	test_method
  method	test_method_simple
  method	test_method_no_network

To allow for unmapped test methods (ie, non-unit tests), name them:

  test_integration_.*

== REQUIREMENTS

* Ruby 1.6+
* Test::Unit
* Rake or rubygems for install/uninstall

== INSTALL

Using Rubygems:

* sudo gem install ZenTest

Using Rake:

* rake test
* sudo rake install
